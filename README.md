This repository contains my solutions and notes for the **CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL** course offered by HarvardX on edX. In this course, I learned the fundamentals of databases, including how to create, read, update, and delete data using SQL (Structured Query Language). The course covers topics such as data normalization, table relationships, indexing, and connecting SQL with programming languages like Python and Java.
